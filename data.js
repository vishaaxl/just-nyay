 The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 is the guardian of every Muslim residing in India. This law governs Muslim marriage, succession, inheritance, and charitable giving among others.    <br/>
    <br/>
Sharia courts protect and enforce Sharia rules, often known as Muslim laws. Muslims are welcome to approach these courts for legal advice. There are no strict and formal court procedures. The Sharia court's verdict is also not legally binding on the parties.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3>
Who requires Muslim law consultation?
    </h3>
 
    <br/>

    <p>
A succession certificate is a legal document that authorises someone to collect debts and manage securities payable in the name of a deceased individual who died intestate (without a valid Will).<br/>
A magistrate or a high court should be required to receive an application for a succession certificate. It confirms the heirs' legitimacy and gives them the power to transfer the deposits and other assets into their names. <br/>
The certificate is essential for the heirs to use in order to lay a claim to the assets of a deceased relative when there is no Will in place. According to the numerous property laws in India, the certificate is necessary whenever someone inherits any moveable or immovable property.<br/>
It should be noted however that if the decedent left a valid Will, the executor of the Will becomes the sole beneficiary of the estate, therefore a succession certificate cannot be issued in such circumstances.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3>
Some key pointers of succession certificate
    </h3>
<br/>
    <ul>
   <li>•	Succession certificates act as the decedent's representative in obtaining any payment owing for securities and/or obligations.
</li>
<li>•	The successor may inherit the decedent's obligations through a succession certificate.
</li>
<li>•	The certificate bearer does not automatically become the legal heir or owner of these assets. The legal heir can be found through a different legal process.
</li>
<li>•	A succession certificate may be withdrawn or cancelled under certain circumstances, such as fraud or improper legal action.

In a lease agreement, the landlord (lessor) and the tenant (lessee) agree to a length of time during which the lessee can use a property that the lessor owns in exchange for recurrent rental payments.<br/>
However, the lease does not grant the tenant ownership rights. The lessor may give the lessee permission to alter the property to suit his purposes, but the lessee does not possess ownership of it. <br/>
Lease contracts may be used to lease real estate, businesses, automobiles, home appliances, parking spots, and others.<br/>
If any legal action is taken against either party, the court will refer to the lease agreement as a valid, legally-binding contract between the landlord and renter.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3>
Things included in a lease agreement
    </h3>
    <br/>
Depending on the type of lease and the particular requirements of the lessee and lessor, the terms of a lease might vary significantly. However, the agreement's fundamental elements include:
<br/>
<br/>
    <ul>
   <li>•	Information on the property, such as the square footage and amenities.
</li>
<li>•	The length of time that the lease agreement will be in force.
</li>
<li>•	The rent that the lessee pays to the lessor in return for using the leased property.
</li>
<li>•	Deposits and conditions governing their return when the lease period is finished.
</li>
<li>•	Utilities that the tenant is responsible for paying for and that are covered by the rent.
</li>
<li>•	As determined by the landlord, upkeep and repairs on the leased property
</li>

A gift deed is an agreement through which a person can gift a movable or immovable property to someone else. It minimizes the chances of disputes in property inheritance or succession cases. A registered gift deed is also proof in itself and unlike a will, the transfer of property is instant and one does not require a court to get it enforced. It is also an important document in succession matters as it is different from a ‘Will’ made by the property owner. A gift deed, just like a sale deed includes all the information regarding the property, the donor, and the donee. It does not deal with financial businesses as it only transfers ownership to the beneficiary. So, if you are looking for a lawyer who can help you with your gift deed registration process then Just Nyay is the right place for you.

    <br/>
MOUs are typically drafted early on in a partnership or project. The following justifications guide the drafting of these documents:
<br/>
<br/>
    <ul>
   <li>MOUs outline the expectations that the parties have of one another.
</li>
<li>•	An MOU enables the parties to express all of their goals in detail and to be on the same page with the agreements made.
</li>
<li>•	A MOU specifies the precise areas of understanding such as identifying the partners, outlining the project, and specifying the obligations.
</li>
<li>•	The document reduces ambiguity and stops unforeseen disputes from happening in the future.
</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3>
Why do you need a lawyer for MOU cases?
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <br/>
Despite the MOU's lack of legal force, violations are occasionally possible. Negotiation is the best course of action in cases of MOU breaches. However, if discussions are unsuccessful, consulting a lawyer for legal advice may be a wise course of action. Your MOU will have the same effects as a typical contract if it was converted into one. In this case, if there is a breach, you can seek legal advice. Consulting a lawyer will be extremely beneficial in cases of MOU breach.<br/>

    <p>
The legal process of changing one's name—whether by adding initials, a single letter, or anything else—is referred to as a name change. When a name is changed, the newly adopted name becomes the person's legal name.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You can choose whatever new name you choose, but only if you abide by a few rules and limitations, such as: 
<br/>
<br/>
    <ul>
   <li>•	You are not allowed to alter your name for dishonest reasons, such as to get out of debt.
</li>
<li>•	You cannot alter your name to one that would jeopardise the rights of someone else, such a famous person.
</li>
<li>•	The name you want to modify shouldn't be offensive or derogatory toward any individual or group of people.
</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3>
Why do people decide to change their names?
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <br/>
Anytime, for any reason, you are allowed to alter your name. However, there are some factors that might compel you to do so, like:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <ul>
<li>•	Birth certificate mistake
</li>
<li>•	Marriage
</li>
<li>•	Spelling mistakes
</li>
<li>•	Religion change 
</li>
<li>•	Astrology or numerology
</li>
<li>•	Dislike the name
</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <h3>
Name-change procedure in India
    </h3>
    <br/>
    <br/>
Anyone in India, older than 18, can change their names by following the necessary formalities, which are:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <ul>
<li>•	To change your name, you must first see a Notary Advocate and get an affidavit.
</li>
<li>•	The following stage entails publishing a notice of your name change in two publications (Vernacular and English).
</li>
<li>•	After that, you must get a notice of your name change published in the Indian Gazette.
</li>
<li>•	As soon as your application is processed, your notification will be printed.
</li>
<li•	Your name is legally altered once the Gazette is printed. 
</li>

    </ul>
